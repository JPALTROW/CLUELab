Code for interpretation from SDR


## Data is ModulatedData.txt was gathered using the following settings:
Central Frequency: 28.134 MHz
Sample Rate: 2.4 MS/s
Total Samples: 2560000 (This is definitely more samples than are needed. It is probably a good idea to only use a fraction of them for analysis purposes)
