# P-Chip SDR Experimentation
Code for interpretation from SDR on radio signals produced by P-Chip


## Data in ModulatedData.txt was gathered using the following settings:
Central Frequency: 28.134 MHz\
Sample Rate: 2.4 MS/s\
Total Samples: 2560000 (This is definitely more samples than are needed. It is probably a good idea to only use a fraction of them for analysis purposes)

These settings can be adjusted in sdrtest.py
